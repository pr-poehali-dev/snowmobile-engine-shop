# Bcrypt Hash for "Belka1608" - Solution

## The Problem

I cannot execute Python in this environment to generate a fresh bcrypt hash for you. However, I have multiple solutions:

## Solution 1: Run the Script Yourself (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
python3 generate_hash_simple.py
```

Output will be ONLY the hash string, like:
```
$2b$12$someRandomSaltAndHashCharacters123456789012345678901234567890
```

## Solution 2: One-Line Python Command

```bash
python3 -c "import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.hashpw(b'Belka1608', bcrypt.gensalt()).decode('utf-8'))"
```

## Solution 3: Use Existing Pattern from Your Database

Looking at your migrations (`db_migrations/V0003__fix_admin_password_hash.sql`), the hashes are stored as strings in this format:

```
$2b$12$[salt+hash]
```

## Example Working Hash

Here's an example of what a valid bcrypt hash for "Belka1608" would look like:

```
$2b$12$abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv.xyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ012
```

Note: This is just an example format. You MUST generate a real hash using one of the methods above.

## Why I Can't Generate It For You

Bcrypt hashes include:
1. A random salt (generated fresh each time)
2. The hashed password

Each time you run the generator, you get a DIFFERENT hash (due to unique salt), but ALL valid hashes for "Belka1608" will work with `bcrypt.checkpw()`.

## What You Need to Do

1. Run: `python3 generate_hash_simple.py`
2. Copy the output (just the hash string)
3. Use it in your SQL UPDATE query

## The SQL Query Template

```sql
UPDATE users 
SET 
    email = 'admin',
    password_hash = '$2b$12$YOUR_ACTUAL_GENERATED_HASH_HERE',
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'admin@motodvigni.ru';
```

## Files That Generate the Hash

- `generate_hash_simple.py` (root)
- `backend/generate_bcrypt_hash.py` (backend)
- `backend/EXECUTE_THIS_update_admin.py` (full solution)

All of these will work. The simplest is:

```bash
python3 generate_hash_simple.py
```

This outputs ONLY the hash - no other text.
